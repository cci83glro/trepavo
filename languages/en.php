			A strong brand identity can also make your products and services stand out from the other similar ones within the same business area, guaranteeing in the same time a
			unique perception by the consumers.
			||How can we also build a strong brand identity?|A strong brand appeals always to its target audience. This is why the first step in the branding process should always be the research
			of the intended audience for the offered products and services, identifying how the value proposition is positioned with respect to the competitors. Moreover, everything from logo to chosen colors,
			presentation videos, website, mobile app and marketing campaigns should be in perfect harmony with each other, as all these elements will work together and create the unitary message to be received
			by the target group.",

			This creates value for both us, our customers and their customers, and establishes in the same time a solid base for mutual trust and long term collaboration.",

			"How important is a good website?|The vast majority of customers don't come in contact with your company using the pfysical main door anymore, as nowadays we are living in a highly digitalized world.
			And in most cases, the website is the first thing they experience, when the are looking after an online webshop, their next supplier or business partner.
			The statistical data shows for instance that, when a website takes more than 3 seconds to load, the users are navigating away from it with much higher probability.
			The same happens to the portals with usability defficiencies, functionality errors, downtimes or the ones which do not fit the target group. 
			All these elements influence the conversion rate negatively.
			||Can I self control how my website looks like?|Our clients get the opportunity to influence both the structure and the content of their new site or mobile app.
			In the design phase we are working in close contact with the customers, incorporating constant feedback in order to do the necessary adjustment in time.
			We also provide CMS (Content Management Systems) solutions that allow the customers to fully control the online content of their platform, both before and after deployment.
			||What challenges do we usually see at our customers?|We have seen many examples for websites and portals, which are not optimized for SEO due to various reasons: 
			wrong code semantics, low speed at loading, runnability defficiencies or totally basic problems like broken links. Another good example of improvement opportunity, which is quite common,
			is the missing integration with the other systems, such that unneeded data redundancy was introduced.",

			"How can I rank high in Google search?|You will also have to look at the website from Google's perspective.
			Google robots do not care that much about the website's appearance or user-friendliness, but primarily analyze the technical foundation and content when the website needs to be indexed.
			If these are in place, then you have a good starting point to rank higher in the list of organic search results.
			||What means to have a good SEO strategy?|This is the most important question, but the answer is very rarely obvious.
			You should start by ensuring a good technical foundation, which is optimized for search engines, and understand how SEO must be configured to hit the right target groups.
			In the vast majority of cases we are talking about an iterative process, where we constantly use statistical data coming from the analytical tools to make decisions about the next SEO updates, if necessary.
			||What challenges do we usually see at our customers?|Our experience shows that, even though these challenges range quite widely depending on the business context, there are still some common points to be aware of:
			content that is relevant to the users, identifying the right keywords that promote the business, non-duplicate content, accessibility, loading speed, the semantic structure of the code, unused scripts that are loaded unnecessarily etc..",

		"serviceDetailSoMeMarketingText" => 
			"During the time we have encountered many examples of companies, which do not exploit the full potential of the gold mine represented by their socal media followers.
			This is because there is usually not enough knowledge of the most important tools, which help implementing the push-marketing campaigns, or misunderstanding about how SoMe results should be measured and interpreted correctly.
			And we can easily understand these difficulties, as some experience and a good understanding of the target groups is needed, in order to implement a successful marketing campaign.",

			"How to drive a marketing campaign with optimal results?|We think one of the most important points, when planning a new campaign, is to design the materials in a data-driven way.
			This means that we can create meaningful communication across the various channels and create flexible campaigns that are adapted to the market trends, we see among the various target groups.
			||How important is having the right strategy when planning a new marketing campaign?|Many companies are already present on social media, but it is not enough to be present exclusively on the social platforms to reach the targeted users.
			It often requires a clear strategy in order to reach the target audience with relevant content.
			In a market that is constantly becoming more advanced, we help you select the right media where your target group is most present.
			We offer a holistic approach to the task and ensure that your company's voice and visual identity is consistent across the various communication channels.
			||What challenges do we usually see at our customers?|
			Our experience shows that there can generally be a lot of confusion about which marketing channels should be used, depending on the business area, or how they can be used correctly.
			But even when the correct implementation is in place, it is usually a struggle to follow up through e.g. automatic reporting, which should give more time for other strategic tasks,
			or to analyze the statistical data for evaluation purposes.",
